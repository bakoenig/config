# Add capability to edit attachments from the compose menu.
#
# Mutt can only edit attachments if they have a mailcap edit entry.
# (This would be a good thing to fix.)  However, a mailcap entry
# apparently must include the display function--it can't be defaulted.
# The combination "cat; copiousoutput" comes close to the default in
# that in invokes the default pager on the output of cat.  However,
# there is apparently no way to specify the default editor--a shell
# environment variable such as $VISUAL or $EDITOR is as close as we can
# get.
